App to display Current weather in a city

Here in this application we make use of openweather api for the weather data 

Here we make use of axios package to import api 

i introduce how to use .env file to store confidential details and make use of these .env file in the gitignore file for security purpose.

More about UI in this APP:
When we input a city Name, APP displays the City Name along with country, Temperature in Celcius, and shows the background corresponding to weather( for example sunny when temp is high)....;)
